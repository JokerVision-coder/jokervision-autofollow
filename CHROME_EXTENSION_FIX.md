# üîß Chrome Extension Fix - Error Resolved!

## ‚ùå The Problem

The Chrome extension was showing an error because the `manifest.json` file contained **invalid permissions** for Manifest V3:

- `"background"` - This permission doesn't exist in Manifest V3 (it's from V2)
- `"webRequest"` - Not needed for our use case (we're using declarativeNetRequest)
- `"identity"` - Not needed (requires OAuth2 configuration)

Chrome was rejecting the extension because of these invalid permissions.

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

I've updated the `manifest.json` file by removing the invalid permissions:

### **Before (Caused Error):**
```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "storage",
  "scripting",
  "identity",        ‚ùå Removed
  "background",      ‚ùå Removed (INVALID in V3)
  "tabs",
  "webRequest",      ‚ùå Removed
  "declarativeNetRequest",
  "contextMenus",
  "notifications",
  "alarms"
]
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "storage",
  "scripting",
  "tabs",
  "declarativeNetRequest",
  "contextMenus",
  "notifications",
  "alarms"
]
```

## üìä Technical Details

**What We Kept:**
- `activeTab` - Access current tab when user clicks extension
- `storage` - Save extension settings
- `scripting` - Inject scripts into Facebook pages
- `tabs` - Manage browser tabs
- `declarativeNetRequest` - Advanced network request handling
- `contextMenus` - Right-click menu options
- `notifications` - Show notifications
- `alarms` - Schedule background tasks

**Background Service Worker:**
- Still works correctly
- No "background" permission needed in V3
- Automatically handles background tasks

---

## üí° Why This Happened

The original manifest.json was created with some Manifest V2 permissions that are no longer valid in Manifest V3. Chrome has strict validation and rejects extensions with invalid permissions.

This is now fixed and fully compliant with Manifest V3 standards.

---

## üÜò If You Still See Errors

1. **Make sure you downloaded the NEW version** (after the fix)
2. **Remove any old versions** of the extension from Chrome
3. **Restart Chrome** completely
4. **Try installing again** with the new ZIP file

If problems persist:
- Check the exact error message in chrome://extensions/
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- Verify you're using the latest Chrome version

## ‚úÖ Ready to Go!

The extension is now fixed and ready for installation. Download the new version and you should have no issues! üöÄ
