## 🔐 Ban Prevention Strategy

### Smart Delays
- Marketplace post: Immediate
- Group 1: +2 minutes
- Group 2: +5 minutes
- Group 3: +8 minutes
- Group 4: +12 minutes
- etc. (randomized 2-5 min intervals)

### Daily Limits (Auto-Enforced)
- Marketplace: 50 posts/day
- Per Group: 5 posts/day maximum
- Total Groups: 10 posts spread across 10 groups = safe
- Weekly rotation: 20 groups = post to different 10 each day

### Behavior Patterns
- Vary posting times (not always 9am)
- Mix post types (not all sales posts)
- Include engagement posts (ask questions, polls)
- Like/comment on other posts periodically
- Mimic human breaks (no posting 2am-6am)

### Account Health Monitor
- Real-time ban risk score
- Warning at 70% risk
- Auto-pause at 85% risk
- Resume recommendations
- Alternative strategies suggested

## 📊 Group Performance Tracking

### Metrics Per Group
- Total posts sent
- Views per post average
- Click-through rate
- Inquiries generated
- Appointments booked
- Sales closed
- ROI calculation

### Best Performer Detection
"Your top 3 groups this month:
1. San Antonio Car Deals (47 inquiries, 8 sales)
2. Texas Truck Traders (31 inquiries, 6 sales)
3. First Time Buyers TX (28 inquiries, 5 sales)

Recommendation: Focus 60% of posts to these groups"
