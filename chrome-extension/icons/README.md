# JokerVision AutoDealer Pro Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for the extension menu
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixel icon for the extension popup
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon for the extension management page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon for the Chrome Web Store

## Icon Requirements:
- All icons should follow the JokerVision branding with the rainbow gradient effect
- Icons should be in PNG format with transparent backgrounds
- The design should include a star or automotive element representing the AI-powered nature of the tool

## Temporary Solution:
For development purposes, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders. The extension will still function without proper icons, but they may appear as generic Chrome extension icons.

## Creating Icons:
1. Design the base icon in 128x128 resolution
2. Scale down to create the smaller versions
3. Ensure all versions maintain visual clarity at their respective sizes
4. Test icons in both light and dark Chrome themes
