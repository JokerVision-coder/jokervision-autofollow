<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was starting the development of a new critical feature: the **Exclusive Lead Engine**. This feature is designed to make JokerVision more powerful in generating exclusive, high-quality leads for car buyers, directly addressing the user's explicit request to surpass competitors like Auto Leads Made Easy.

The current progress includes:
1.  **File Creation**: A new React frontend component file, , was successfully created. This file will house the UI and logic for this advanced lead generation system.
2.  **Integration**: The AI engineer's last action was to integrate this new component into the main application's routing () and to start creating the necessary backend API endpoints in  to support its functionality. This sets the foundation for connecting the frontend UI with the backend logic for lead generation.

The work is at the very initial stage of implementing this feature, focusing on establishing its frontend component and preparing the backend API infrastructure. The goal is to ensure JokerVision can acquire high-quality car buyer leads effectively.
