The AI engineer's work involved extensive feature development for the JokerVision AutoFollow application. Initially, it built out a React Native mobile app, integrated OpenAI Realtime Voice AI, and refined backend API endpoints. Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing predictive analytics (ML models), real-time WebSockets, and an AI-Powered Unified Inbox across web and mobile platforms.

Significant recent efforts concentrated on the Intelligent Workflow Automation system, enhancing its backend logic with car sales knowledge, creating its frontend component, and resolving several integration and display issues. The engineer also addressed critical UI/UX problems, including a complete redesign of the overflowing navigation menu and updating the entire application's color scheme from purple to a professional blue/cyan theme. Inventory management was significantly enhanced with more detailed mock data and a vehicle details modal. A Facebook Marketplace Auto Poster and a Social Media & App Integration Center were developed. The latest major feature is a Lead Generation Hub, focused on achieving 10 appointments/day per sales rep. The work concluded with starting the implementation of an Exclusive Lead Engine after a competitor analysis.
