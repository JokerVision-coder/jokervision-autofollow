The AI engineer successfully guided the user from initial application deployment to a feature-rich sales management platform, JokerVision AutoFollow. The journey began with deploying a basic FastAPI backend and React frontend to Railway/Vercel, addressing an initial  database migration. Subsequent development rapidly introduced core functionalities: Leads Management, Creative Studio (including social media templates), and Shottenkirk Toyota inventory integration (using mock data with enhanced image display). Extensive UI/UX refinements were performed, notably changing the application's background to a neutral dark theme for better visibility. The application's scope expanded significantly with the addition of a Website Builder, a comprehensive Ads Manager (supporting Google Ads, Craigslist, and major social media platforms), a Unified Communication Inbox, and a Drag & Drop Sales Pipeline. The work is currently progressing on implementing critical features identified from a competitive analysis, with a focus on Reviews Management and Mass SMS/Email Marketing, consistently incorporating user feedback.

The user, a car salesman, sought an AI-powered lead management system, JokerVision AutoFollow, to automate follow-ups and appointment setting. The initial vision included lead CRUD, multi-language welcome messages, AI chat (appointment-focused, dealership-specific knowledge), real SMS integration, sales tracking, social media ROI, compliance, mobile/desktop versions, bulk contact import, a Creative Studio for ads/organic strategy, and a Chrome extension for FB Marketplace inventory upload with AI SEO. The platform also needed multi-tenant and subscription capabilities.

Currently implemented features:
- Core Lead Management (CRUD, search, status, Facebook Messenger integration, bulk import).
- AI Integration (chat with Emergent LLM key, inventory context, SMS).
- Sales & Team Management (dashboard, commissions, user CRUD, appointments).
