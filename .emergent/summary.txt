The AI engineer successfully progressed JokerVision AutoFollow from an MVP to a feature-rich sales management platform. Initial work involved deploying a FastAPI backend and React frontend, addressing database migration, and introducing core functionalities like Leads Management, Creative Studio, and mocked inventory integration. UI/UX was refined with a neutral dark theme. Subsequent development rapidly expanded the platform to include a Website Builder, Ads Manager, Unified Communication Inbox, and a Drag & Drop Sales Pipeline. The final push saw the implementation of Mass SMS/Email Marketing (with Twilio/SendGrid), a Social Media Hub (Meta/TikTok), an enhanced Chrome extension for Facebook Marketplace automation and lead appointment generation, Reviews Management, Calendar, Workflow Builder, AI Toolkit, Subscription Management, Advanced Website Builder, Voice Integration, Advanced Analytics, and a Mobile App component. Dependency management and an ObjectId serialization fix were also handled.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a significant development sprint, addressing most of the remaining product requirements and user requests. This involved implementing a comprehensive Mass SMS & Email Marketing system, integrating Twilio and SendGrid, and connecting the existing  frontend with new backend endpoints. A Unified Social Media Hub was developed for Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and TikTok, complete with backend API endpoints and a new  frontend component. The Chrome Extension was substantially enhanced to automate Facebook Marketplace inventory uploads and lead appointment generation, involving updates to  and new backend endpoints.

Furthermore, dedicated frontend components were created and integrated into the  routing and navigation for  (which was enhanced), , , , , , , and . All corresponding backend endpoints for these features were also implemented in . A critical issue involving MongoDB's ObjectId serialization in marketing campaign and segment endpoints was identified and fixed in  to ensure proper JSON responses. The final action taken was the creation of a  component, establishing a foundation for future mobile application development. Services were consistently restarted to apply all new dependencies and code changes.
