The previous AI engineer systematically advanced the JokerVision AutoFollow application from an MVP to a robust lead management system. Initial efforts focused on critical bug fixes across dashboard statistics and the Exclusive Leads page, followed by UI/UX improvements like functional automation rule toggles and a Calendar Integration settings modal. A significant update integrated the CRISP sales methodology into AI agents, and the Creative Studio was redesigned into a template-driven content generator. More recently, the engineer implemented a bulk lead upload feature, integrated lead source tracking across various modules (Website Builder, Walk-In Tracker, Exclusive Lead Engine, Facebook Marketplace), and developed an All Leads Dashboard with enhanced lead details and bulk AI communication setup. Documentation and external setup guides were also created and refined for accessibility. Twilio integration for SMS/voice communication was successfully configured. The latest interaction involves the user reporting an unresponsive Add Lead button in the Sales Pipeline and needing guidance on installing the Chrome extension, which the engineer was addressing by preparing the extension for download.

The  function in  was inspected, but the root cause of the non-responsiveness was not fully identified or fixed.
