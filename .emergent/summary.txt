The AI engineer successfully transformed JokerVision AutoFollow from an MVP into a feature-rich sales management platform. Initial efforts focused on integrating the MobileApp component, addressing UI inconsistencies, and mocking absent backend endpoints. Subsequently, the SocialMediaHub was validated. A major enhancement involved overhauling the Inventory Management system, surpassing competitors by introducing advanced features and new frontend/backend modules. Two new core dealership functionalities, Walk-In Tracker and Vehicle Wishlist, were then implemented. The AI Bot system was developed to outperform FBAutoReplyAI, necessitating some refactoring from  to  to resolve parsing errors. Following V1.0 release confirmation, the project shifted to a strategic roadmap. Phase 1, Real AI Integration, was initiated, successfully integrating Emergent LLM and OpenAI Realtime Voice AI (via ). The work is currently progressing on Phase 2, the React Native Mobile App development, setting up its foundational structure.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on **Phase 2: React Native Mobile App Development**, a key part of the strategic roadmap to expand JokerVision's ecosystem. The goal is to build a companion mobile application that provides real-time notifications and mobile inventory management, complementing the existing web platform.

The current progress includes laying the foundational structure for this mobile application:
1.  The  root directory has been created.
2.  A  file for React Native has been initialized, and initial dependencies have been installed.
3.  The main  component for the mobile application has been set up.
4.  Essential directory structures for  and  have been established within .
5.  Key screen components,  and , have been created as placeholders for the main interface and the revolutionary voice AI feature, respectively.
6.  An initial service file, , has been created within the  directory.

The work is at the stage of building out the core components and services for the mobile application to enable its planned functionalities and eventual integration with the existing backend.
