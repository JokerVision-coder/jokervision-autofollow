The trajectory details the development of JokerVision AutoFollow, a comprehensive car salesman lead management system. The AI engineer incrementally built features based on user requests, starting with a basic lead system, then adding SMS, AI responses, appointment scheduling, and multi-channel integrations (Voice, FB Messenger). Subsequent phases focused on transforming it into a patent-ready SaaS platform with sales tracking, collaborator management, social media ROI optimization, compliance features, mobile/desktop versions, a creative studio, and a Chrome extension. The AI engineer consistently followed a pattern of clarifying requirements, performing bulk file writes, making granular edits, installing dependencies, restarting services, and conducting comprehensive testing with screenshots. Key technical decisions included using FastAPI, React, MongoDB, Shadcn UI, Emergent LLM Key, and specific third-party integrations, while adhering to strict environment and design guidelines. The process involved multiple iterations of feature addition, debugging, and UI/UX refinement.

<product_requirements>
The user, a car salesman, required an application to automate lead follow-ups and appointment setting. Initially, this involved a lead management system for manual and bulk input, immediately sending welcome messages (English/Spanish), scheduling, and AI-powered responses. The vision evolved to include real SMS integration (TextBelt), Google Calendar suggestions (though a custom calendar was implemented), and an AI bot expertly focused on appointment setting (not selling vehicles), using pipeline-based follow-up messages.

Later, the user requested an AI Voice Agent for cold calling and integration with Facebook Messenger for leads. The AI bot needed to be educated with dealership-specific information (Shottenkirk Toyota San Antonio, new/pre-owned vehicles). The branding was updated to JokerVision AutoFollow with a custom design. Further requirements included a sales tracking dashboard with commission calculations for up to 3 collaborators, transforming the app into a patent-ready SaaS platform with multi-tenant and subscription capabilities, integrating social media ad ROI optimization (FB, TikTok, LinkedIn, Instagram), and implementing compliance features to prevent account suspensions. Finally, the user requested robust mobile/desktop versions, bulk contact import (Excel/CSV), a Creative Studio for ad material generation and organic social media strategy, and a Chrome extension for FB Marketplace inventory upload and AI-driven SEO descriptions.

<current_work>
The most immediate work before this summary request was to integrate a Chrome extension with Facebook Marketplace for dealership inventory uploads and AI-driven SEO descriptions, as well as a Creative Studio for advertisement materials and organic social media strategy. The AI engineer had just started on the Chrome extension, successfully creating  and . Prior to that, the backend was updated to include API endpoints for the Creative Studio and organic strategy, and the frontend's  was updated to include the Creative Studio component with device detection logic. The previous step was creating the  file. The current state is that the framework for the Chrome extension and Creative Studio exists, but their core functionalities are not yet fully implemented.
