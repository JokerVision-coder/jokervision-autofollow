The AI engineer successfully guided the user through deploying the JokerVision AutoFollow application. Initial work involved expanding Chrome extension files and adding backend API endpoints, which were tested. The core of the trajectory focused on deploying the application to a production environment. This involved detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up MongoDB Atlas, deploying the backend to Railway, and the frontend to Vercel. Extensive troubleshooting was required due to user-side errors in GitHub (empty repository, incorrect folder structures, missing frontend files) and Railway (private dependencies, CLI issues). The frontend structure was eventually rebuilt from scratch on GitHub. By the end, a minimal working frontend and a simplified backend were successfully deployed and connected, with the database also linked. The conversation then pivoted to a comprehensive plan for further development, commercialization, and patenting, with the user prioritizing the core sales rep workflow for immediate testing. The AI engineer's last action was to provide the full backend code for an update on GitHub.

The user, a car salesman, sought an AI-powered lead management system, JokerVision AutoFollow, to automate follow-ups and appointment setting. Initial features included lead CRUD, multi-language welcome messages, AI chat focused on appointments (not sales), real SMS integration (TextBelt), and dealership-specific AI knowledge. The vision expanded into a patent-ready SaaS platform with sales tracking (3 collaborators, tiered commission), social media ROI optimization (FB, TikTok, LinkedIn, Instagram), compliance features, robust mobile/desktop versions, bulk contact import (Excel/CSV), a Creative Studio for ad generation and organic strategy, and a Chrome extension for FB Marketplace inventory upload with AI-driven SEO descriptions. The platform also needed multi-tenant and subscription capabilities. Currently, the application has a basic but functional frontend on Vercel and a full backend (ready to be deployed to Railway) with MongoDB Atlas connectivity, supporting the initial lead management and AI features, with placeholders for advanced integrations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the application achieved a successfully deployed minimal frontend (React on Vercel) and a simplified backend (FastAPI on Railway) with a connected MongoDB Atlas database. The user's explicit request was to proceed with the comprehensive development plan for patenting and commercialization, starting with the core sales rep workflow. This involves restoring the full AI functionality and real data integration.

The AI engineer's current action is to update the GitHub repository for  with the complete, full-featured  and an updated . This is to replace the previously deployed simplified backend version, which had  and related AI dependencies removed to facilitate initial deployment to Railway. The full  includes robust lead management models, SMS, AI chat (with ), appointment scheduling, and dashboard statistics. The updated  re-introduces  and other necessary libraries. Once these files are updated on GitHub, Railway will automatically redeploy the backend with full functionality.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Confirm the successful deployment of the full backend to Railway and then proceed with testing the core sales rep workflow features.
