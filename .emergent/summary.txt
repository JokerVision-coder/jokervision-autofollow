The AI engineer's work involved significantly expanding the JokerVision AutoFollow application. The trajectory details the completion of Phase 2: React Native Mobile App Development, including setting up its foundation, creating services and screens, integrating OpenAI Realtime Voice AI, and resolving dependency issues. Concurrently, backend API endpoints were refined for mobile compatibility, addressing duplicate routes and  handling.

Following mobile app completion, the focus shifted to Phase 1: Real AI Integration. This involved implementing revolutionary predictive analytics with ML models for both web and mobile platforms, enhancing ML API response structures. Subsequently, real-time WebSocket features were introduced, which required significant debugging to correctly place endpoints within the FastAPI router. Finally, a comprehensive AI-Powered Unified Inbox was developed, integrating AI for rapid responses and marketing campaigns, and its backend and frontend components were implemented. The work concluded with the initiation of an intelligent workflow automation system.

The JokerVision AutoFollow aims to be an AI-powered lead management system for car salesmen. Its initial scope included automated follow-ups, appointment setting, lead CRUD, multi-language support, AI chat, real SMS, sales tracking, social media ROI, compliance, mobile/desktop versions, bulk contact import, Creative Studio, Chrome extension for FB Marketplace, and multi-tenant/subscription support.

Currently, the platform has evolved to include: Core Lead Management, AI Integration (Emergent LLM), Sales & Team Management, Creative Studio, mocked Real Inventory Integration, an enhanced Chrome Extension, Website & Funnel Builder, Multi-platform Ads Manager, Unified Communication Inbox, Drag & Drop Sales Pipeline, Reviews Management, Mass SMS & Email Marketing, Social Media Hub, Calendar Integration, Workflow Builder, AI Toolkit, Subscription Management, Voice Integration, Advanced Social Media ROI Analytics, and a  component. Recent additions encompass advanced Inventory Management, Walk-In Tracker, Vehicle Wishlist, and a Superior AI Bot. The latest work focused on integrating real AI capabilities and building a React Native mobile application, adding predictive analytics, real-time features (WebSockets), and an AI-powered unified inbox.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively developing the Intelligent Workflow Automation system, a new advanced feature for the backend.

The current progress includes:
1.  **File Creation**: A new Python file, , was successfully created. This file is expected to house the core logic for managing and executing automated workflows.
2.  **Backend Integration**: The workflow automation engine has been integrated into the main FastAPI application, . New API endpoints related to workflow automation (e.g., status, execution) were added to the  file, specifically *before* the existing realtime endpoints, to ensure proper routing within the .
3.  **Service Restart**: The backend service was stopped and restarted to load the newly implemented  module and make the new API endpoints accessible.

The work is at the stage of integrating and testing the foundational components of the workflow automation system, ensuring the new backend endpoints are operational and the system is ready for further development. The next immediate step is to test these new endpoints.
