### Leads not appearing in JokerVision
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify your JokerVision app is running
  - Check that the backend is accessible
  - Open browser console (press F12) and check for errors
  - Make sure the extension is enabled (toggle is blue)

### Extension shows errors
- **Solution**: Click the "Errors" button on the extension card in chrome://extensions/ to see error details. Most common issue is network connectivity to your JokerVision backend.
